- **Displaying the secret word:** Length of the secret word is displayed via underscores to the user
- **Selection of letter:** User can select a letter to guess 
- **Correct Selection:** User will see the letter placed in its correct spot(s) in the word 
- **Incorrect Selection:** Letter will be placed in a separate box and the remaining guesses count will decrease by 1
- **User lost:** User can make six incorrect guesses before the computer wins
- **User won:** User guessed all the letters in the secret word before the six chances are up


### Going beyond the MVP: 
- **Difficulty Level:** User can select a difficulty level based off how lucky they're feeling or how skilled they're are. Difficulty levels include easy, medium, hard, and surprise me.
- **Leaderboard:** Members who have played at least one game are automatically added to the leaderboard. The board shows the top users by their win rates (games won / games played).
- **Friendship:** Members can connect with other members via a friendship. This makes it easier for users to track how their friends are doing without skimming through the leaderboard. 
- **Bandaids:** Members are given three bandaids when they sign up. They can use these bandaids as lifelines to restore one body part in the middle of the game 
- **Hangman Display:** Users can see the physical hangman diagram as they guess incorrectly 
- **Quit Button:** Users can quit in the middle of the game if they choose 
- **Share Buttons:** If a user wins a game, they can showcase their awesomeness by sharing a Tweet or a LinkedIn post. 
- **Spotify:** Who doesn't love to listen to upbeat music as they play word games? Spotify users have the capability to listen to music as they play
